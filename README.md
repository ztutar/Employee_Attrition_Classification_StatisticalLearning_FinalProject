# Statistical Learning Final Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Statistical Learning** course and involves the application of machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset. The goal is to explore statistical learning methods, evaluate model performance, and derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Repository Structure
```
Statistical-Learning_Final-Project-master/
├── data/                 # Contains the dataset (train.csv, test.csv)
├── TUTAR_OZEN_Project_Rmd.Rmd  # R Markdown file with code and analysis
├── TUTAR_OZEN_Project_Report.pdf  # Project report
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Dataset
The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder and consists of:
- `train.csv`: Training data used to train machine learning models.
- `test.csv`: Test data used to evaluate model performance.
- `README.txt`: Additional details about the dataset.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open `TUTAR_OZEN_Project_Rmd.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Install required R packages if not already installed:
3. Run the R Markdown file to execute the analysis and generate outputs.

## Results
The project findings, analysis, and results are documented in:
- **TUTAR_OZEN_Project_Report.pdf** (Detailed project report)
